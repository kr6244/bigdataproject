the project has basically 3 parts - 
1. we created our own cluster in our lab with 7-8 computers . in which one was Name Node and the others were Data Node .
 -> 1. we first implemented HDFS . uploaded a file of around 4 GB in our cluster.
 -> 2. we perform Map reduce . basically we run a program for word count on that file .
 -> 3. we implemeted hive in which we created a database and perform ceratin operation in it.
2. we created our cluster using AWS instances . // at run time it asks user about the no of instances to launch  and then make one of those instances Namenode and othe datanode.
3. we created our cluster using DOCKER.
